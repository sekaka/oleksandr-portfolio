# Building a Modern Developer Portfolio with AI: A Complete Guide Using Claude Code

*Published on January 22, 2025*

As a full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience working primarily with Vue.js and Electron, I decided it was time to build a modern portfolio website that showcased my framework-agnostic capabilities. The twist? I wanted to use AI for as much of the development process as possible, leveraging Claude Code to build a Next.js portfolio with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Supabase, and Vercel.

This is the complete story of how I went from initial idea to deployed portfolio in a single day, with AI handling the heavy lifting while I focused on requirements and design decisions.

## The Tech Stack

Before diving into the process, here's what we built with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for a modern design system
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database with real-time features)
- **Hosting**: Vercel with automatic CI/CD
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Code for development and Claude Desktop for planning
